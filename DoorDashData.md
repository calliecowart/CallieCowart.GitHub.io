## A Deep Dive into DoorDash Data
<br><br>
I'm a sucker for a good promo. Every week, I get a notification on my phone from DoorDash and other delivery apps with their latest offers. This week, after giving into temptation and placing an order, I assured myself that I'm not the only one who can't pass up a good deal. In an attempt to validate my most recent purchase, I wanted to look at the data to see if other people do the same. How many people are drawn to food delivery apps by marketing campaigns? What encourages some people to order more than others?
<br>
With the help of a dataset I found online, I was able to answer these questions and more to curb my curious appetite. After importing over 2,000 rows of data into Excel, I learned that:
<br>
$1.24 million was spent by customers between 2014-2016
<br>
67.7% of the spend variance can be explained by income levels
<br>
An average of 7.5% of customers placed an order following each marketing campaign
